This is where my visual argument project will begin to emerge 

**Proposal**

For my visual argument project I want to highlight the issue of food insecurity, specifically on college campuses. Oakland itself is a food desert and many students find it increasingly hard to access healthy and affordable food, especially those who don't have the expensive Pitt meal plans. So for my argument I plan to make some type of visual of a desert with a few pieces of food, with text that reads "everyone deserves access to food" and "40% of college students experience food insecurity." My goal with this is to highlight the issue of food deserts and the fact that many students silently suffer with not having proper access to nutritious food.

**FINAL REFLECTION**

For my visual argument I focused on highlighting the issue of food insecurity on college campuses. This is a topic I have been interested in for quite some time and I even reported on it a few times for The Pitt News. Because food insecurity is especially an issue on college campuses like Pitt’s where the city we are located in is a food desert, I decided to specifically emphasize the fact that not having access to food is like living in a desert. So the image displays a desert overlapping with an image of produce at a grocery store, to replace the sky. The main two texts in my project read “No one should have to live in a desert” and “1 in 3 college students don’t have access to fresh produce” in order to emphasize my main points. This is what one of my first formats for the project looked like with the main argument on top and the stat on the lower half of the page. My thought process was to somewhat follow Gestalt principles and have people read the text in order from top to bottom. But one suggestion I got from a peer made me rework the positioning of my texts to prioritize visual cohesiveness.

Josie noted that the placement of the text seemed weird and would make more sense if they were flipped around:

While I originally wanted to have people read the ‘desert’ text first, as Josie notes it did make more sense to have the text about the desert over the desert and the text about the food over the food. So I flipped it and just made sure that the size and prominence of the two texts would contrast enough so that people would see the “No one should have to live in a desert” as the most important thing and then see the stat as a supplementary fact to prove my point.

Another thing I did with this project is use different editing techniques and effects. In the past I’ve only ever used photoshop to add simple text over a photo, so with this project I wanted to expand and get more creative with photoshop to present a visually appealing image as well. With that in mind I added quite a few filters on my images, did some color correction and also found a way to add the dark gradient to add a smooth transition to the two images of the food and the desert.

In my final version of the project I ultimately changed quite a few things from the first draft. I cut the bottom part of the desert out where the weeds and grass were. I changed the coloring of the food and lessened some of the blur on it because I felt like I originally had it so blurred to the point where it looked pixelated. I also switched the location of the text and changed what originally said 40% to ‘1 out of 3’ because I felt it flowed better with the overall look of the image. Lastly, I also added a text that reads “Visit swipehunger.org to learn more” in the bottom right corner. I felt like this text was especially important to include because the visual argument itself only provides a little bit of information with a stat. While visual arguments are good in terms of bringing awareness to an issue by getting people’s attention, they provide limited amount of information so it's important to give people the opportunity to expand their knowledge and understanding of an issue by directing them to another source. I specifically chose to use swipehunger.org because it's an organization that specifically focuses on combating food insecurity on college campuses, by educating people and providing resources to students who may experience food insecurity or who live in food deserts. This website also provides specific stats on food insecurity including the one included in my visual argument that “1 out of 3 college student don’t have access to fresh produce.”

Overall, I’m pleased with the final product of my project. While it did take me a lot of time and trial and error to decide how I want to present the argument, I think what I ultimately went with presents the argument in the best way possible while also being visually pleasing and cohesive. And overall, I think I met all the baseline requirements as well as some of the aspirational goals when it comes to creativity in effects and editing.
