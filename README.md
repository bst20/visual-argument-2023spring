A rhetorical collage assignment for Benjamin Miller's course in [Composing Digital Media](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/)

This is where my visual argument project will begin to emerge 

**Proposal**

For my visual argument project I want to highlight the issue of food insecurity, specifically on college campuses. Oakland itself is a food desert and many students find it increasingly hard to access healthy and affordable food, especially those who don't have the expensive Pitt meal plans. So for my argument I plan to make some type of visual of a desert with a few pieces of food, with text that reads "everyone deserves access to food" and "40% of college students experience food insecurity." My goal with this is to highlight the issue of food deserts and the fact that many students silently suffer with not having proper access to nutritious food.
